Computer Vision 1 - Project Bag-of-Words based Image Classification.

The goal of the assignment was to implement a system for image classification, in other words, this system should tell if there is an object of given class in an image. We performed four-class (airplanes, motorbikes, faces, and cars) image classification based on bag-of-words approach. The provided data file contains training and test subdirectories for each category (all images are taken from Caltech Vision Group). For each class, test subdirectories contain 50 images, and training subdirectories contain up to 500 images. We tested our system on all the test images, and trained it on at least 50 training images per class.

Bag-of-Words based Image Classification system contains the following steps: 

(1) Feature Extraction and Description
(2) Building a Visual Vocabulary
(3) Quantize features using visual dictionary (encoding)
(4) Representing images by frequencies of visual words
(5) Classification.
